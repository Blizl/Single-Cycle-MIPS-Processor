2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_clk/xnew0_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_clk/xnew0_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell debounce_clk/xnew0_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net instruction_decoder/RegWrite_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin instruction_decoder/RegWrite_reg_i_2/O, cell instruction_decoder/RegWrite_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net instruction_decoder/immediate_reg[7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin instruction_decoder/immediate_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell instruction_decoder/immediate_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net instruction_decoder/rd_addr_reg[1]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin instruction_decoder/rd_addr_reg[1]_i_1/O, cell instruction_decoder/rd_addr_reg[1]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
